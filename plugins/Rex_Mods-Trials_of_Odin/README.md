# Trials of Odin: A Difficulty Enhancement Mod

This mod was created to increase the difficulty, add some mechanics, and make Valheim dangerous again!

## Implemented Features:

### Base Features

- Configurable boss scaling that :
  - Takes a value from the config, and uses that to overwrite the default game scaling.
  - Scaling is applied to health, damage, and movement speed.
  - Scaling is also based on number of players. Higher player count around boss spawn = much harder bosses.
  - Optional config to force scaling to set number of players.
- Toggleable boss rage mode that increases boss attack frequency below half health.
- Toggleable increased base enemy difficulty. Enemies have a 95% chance of spawning lvl 1-4, 4% chance of spawning 5-7, and 1% chance of spawning 8-10. Loot is based on those "Tiers" that they fall into. Max loot that can be dropped is that of a 2\* enemy.

### Event System

- Toggleable Event System Overhaul: Events can now be bound to the player so that they only receive events they've "unlocked"

## Planned Features

- Allow bosses to spawn their corresponding events during boss fights.
- Increase portal construction cost to add 5 Bronze Bars.
- Anything else **_sadistic_** I can come up with, or that you recommend!

Added same move speed scaling from bosses to regular enemies, as well as added move scaling for flying enemies... Beware the **_Rocketsquito_**. Fixed potential loot drop issues.

- **V1.3.0**: I was an idiot before. Stars will now show up appropriately. 0* for bottom tier, 1* for mid tier, & 2\* for high tier. Enemies will also now have the appropriate coloring for their tier as well. Also slightly adjusted loot so that it won't overspawn loot.
- **V1.2.1**: Fixed error causing stars to show up incorrectly.
