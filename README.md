# ErendilModpack
Valheim Modpack for the Erendil Server (r2modman &amp; BepInEx)
NOTE: These mods are made by their respective authors. This Modpack is only a compilation with default configurations.

This Modpack in general focuses on online-play with Friends with some QoL improvements:

Dependencies:
- BepInEx

Included QoL:
- AutoRepair by Tekla
- NonrestrictedPortals by xAfflict
- ServerSideMap by Mydayyy
- TorchesEternal by Xenofell
- RememberIPDamnit by Xenofell
- PaddlePower by mgway
- VChat by ItsKaa
- FirstPerson by Masa
- CraftingWithContainers by abearcodes

Penalty Mods:
- TrialsOfOdin by Rex_Mods
- FortifySkills by Merlyn42
- Gravekeeper by mtnewton

Current penalty rules:
(1.1.0) Gear and consumables are kept on death, materials are left behind in a gravestone. Skills won't drop endlessly but stay at your 'fortified level' minimum. To counter this decrease in difficulty which makes death less important but also less annoying, all mobs are increased by one star, and bosses are tuned much harder.

Note that the included mods are not included as r2modman dependencies but snapshots are taken to assume the server and the clients are running the same version.
