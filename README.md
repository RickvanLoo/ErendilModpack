NOTE: These mods are made by their respective authors. This Modpack is only a compilation with default configurations.

This Modpack in general focuses on online-play with Friends with some QoL improvements:

- No fuel needed for campfires etc. (This prevents fires from going out if they are not playing)
- Global Server Chat
- Global Map Sharing
- Autoremember Server IP
- More players = Faster paddling

QoL:
- Portals are non-restricted
- Farming has a cultivating grid
- Crafting tables take materials from Containers within reach
- Do not lose items upon death
- First person Camera options


Planned:
- Make Wards available on start
- Balancing between difficulty and death penalty of losing skill/items.
