Valheim Modpack for the Erendil Server (r2modman &amp; BepInEx)
NOTE: These mods are made by their respective authors. This Modpack is only a compilation with default configurations.

This Modpack in general focuses on online-play with Friends with some QoL improvements:

Dependencies:
- BepInEx

Included QoL:
- AutoRepair by Tekla

Note that the included mods are not included as r2modman dependencies but snapshots are taken to assume the server and the clients are running the same version. 

Current penalty rules:
(1.1.0) Gear and consumables are kept on death, materials are left behind in a gravestone. Skills won't drop endlessly but stay at your 'fortified level' minimum. To counter this decrease in difficulty which makes death less important but also less annoying, all mobs are increased by one star, and bosses are tuned much harder.

Changelog (1.2.0):
- Applied speed increase to Bosses (Trying to Balance)
- Changed mob spawning to the following settings:
89% for lvl 2-3 (Normal star 1 & 2)
10% for lvl 4-5 (Above normal difficulty)
1% for lvl 6-8 (High difficulty)
- Enabled BetterUI (2x distance, view mob level, disable XP bar)
- Enabled Data Rate modifier (x10) for Server Desync issues.
- Disabled CraftingWithContainers for Wood in Kiln (You need the wood in your inventory!)
